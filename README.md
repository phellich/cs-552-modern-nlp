# CS-552: Modern Natural Language Processing

### Course Description
Natural language processing is ubiquitous in modern intelligent technologies, serving as a foundation for language translators, virtual assistants, search engines, and many more. In this course, we cover the foundations of modern methods for natural language processing, such as word embeddings, recurrent neural networks, transformers, and pretraining, and how they can be applied to important tasks in the field, such as machine translation and text classification. We also cover issues with these state-of-the-art approaches (such as robustness, interpretability, sensitivity), identify their failure modes in different NLP applications, and discuss analysis and mitigation techniques for these issues.

### Project (60%):
The project will involve using large-scale language models (100B+ parameters) and medium-scale (300M parameters) in the domain of education.  The project will be divided into 2 milestones and a final submission. Each milestone will be worth 15% of the final grade with the remaining 30% being allocated to the final report. Each team will be supervised by one of the course TAs or AEs. 

<!-- More details on the content of the project and the deliverables of each milestone will be released at a later date. -->
Registration details can be found in the announcement [here][1p].

<!-- #### Proposal (5%):
- For the proposal, students will be responsible for delivering a Project Plan for executing the goals of the project, as well as submitting a list of relevant literature, demonstrating they have identified academic papers that are relevant for each of the portions of the milestones of the project. Each student in the group should review one of these papers and submit it with Milestone 1.
- Due: 21 Apr 2023 -->

#### Milestone 1 (15%):
- Milestone 1 parameters can be found in the [project description][2p].

#### Final Deliverable (30%):

- More details can be found in the [project description][2p].
- Due: 15 Jun 2023

### Late Days Policy
All assignments and milestones are due at 11:59 PM on their due date. As we understand that circumstances can make it challenging to abide by these due dates, you will receive 6 late days over the course of the semester to be allocated to the assignments and project milestones as you see fit. No further extensions will be granted. The only exception to this rule is for the final report, code, and data. No extensions will be granted beyond June 15th.
